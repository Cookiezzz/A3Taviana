The purpose of this remake is to provide a single set of client files which all server hosts can use.

This way all people who want to play Taviana will only have to download one set of files, which prevents confusion and problems.

 

To do this, there is a couple of things that I'd like you all to consider.

 

    This is NOT finished. There might still be missing textures etc. (Haven't had one in 10 hours)
    Do NOT change stuff yourself in the client files. It would destroy the entire purpose of having one set of files.
    If you find any bugs/errors, feel free to contact me and maybe I can fix them in a next update.

 

Before anyone flaming that I post a link to my own forums for the download

Because of the fact that the Taviana author does NOT allow Epochmod to talk/post/.. his work, I CANNOT post a direct download link here.

I however can guide u to the topic that has it ;)

 

You don't have to sign up to download it, but I'd appreciate if you could rate the file.
