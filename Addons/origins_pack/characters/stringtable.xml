			<Original>Name: Isabella Fernandez (Spain)\nAge: 19\nOccupation: Student.\n\nIsabella had just finished her first year of college when zombies reached Barcelona, and nothing in her comfortable life had prepared her for the apocalypse. Even she couldn't say how she has managed to survive, but somehow she always has a weapon in hand, no matter how primitive, when the undead find her again. Isabella and a few of her fellow students managed to escape Barcelona to the Pyrenees where they had once gone mountain climbing on weekends, living high enough in the mountains that the zombies couldn't follow. When the survivors there connected to survivornet, Isabella was one of the first to volunteer for the mission to Taviana.\n\nSkills: Coming soon.</Original>

			<German>Name: Philippe Renard (France)\nAge: 56\nOccupation: Pickpocket\n\nPhilippe Renard is a mass of contradictions: an orderly and meticulous man who enjoys the intricacies of clocks and makes his living as a pickpocket; a gourmand who adores a complex dish and a good wine before a night of cat burglary. It was Philippe's habit of collecting antique and unusual pistols that saved him from the zombies, and his skill in watch repair parlayed nicely into gunsmithing. Unfortunately these skills could not save his daughter, the only thing he ever loved, and so Philippe volunteered for the expedition to Taviana.\n\nSkills: Coming soon.</German>
